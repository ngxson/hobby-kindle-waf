# ReactJS Kindle WAF Template

Building applications for Kindle has never been that easy. Now with ReactJS, you can build simple applications faster and easier.

## Debugging

A production WAF will read HTML/JS/CSS files directly on your Kindle. However, imagine each time you want to change something, you will need to build, then copy the app to your Kindle.

This module allows connecting Kindle to ReactJS dev server running on a computer. Requirement: both Kindle and the computer are on the same network.
